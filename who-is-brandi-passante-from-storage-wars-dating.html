Along with a bird, Passante had the word “Free” tattooed on the inside of her middle finger. She wrote that the tattoo was inspired by a “very difficult situation” she escaped from.&nbsp;</p><p>“Although everyone assumes, this means that I am a huge ‘[Lynyrd] Skynyrd’ fan…I do love this song!” Passante wrote. “But, this tattoo means so much more. To me, it means that somehow, by the grace of god, I managed to escape a very difficult situation that so many people fall victim to. I will be eternally grateful, for the life and freedom, without fear that I get to live now. I am also grateful for the empathy and grace that I am able to give others as a result of the things that I have endured!
