He is facing the ax in 'The Morning Show' and in episode 7, Fred (Tom Irwin) has already looked into a replacement for him, one Mr. Marlin Tate, and he wants Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup), the head of News division to meet Tate.</p><p>Chip is aware his days with 'The Morning Show' are numbered and he is desperate to make things right. His reason for firing Nicky (David Magidoff) is also a result of his insecurity. He is worried about how he would be perceived as the executive producer of the show if he stood by Nicky's comments against Mia.</p><p><a href=# rel>The fact this works against Mia is not something that he expected</a>. He meets Cory to explain he has proof that alludes to Fred's complicity. Fred enabling a toxic work culture is another avenue that can be pursued.</p><p>However, none of this connects directly to Fred, but Chip explains he knows reporters who are trustworthy and can investigate this angle to help both himself and Cory. Of course, Cory is a lot smarter and tells Chip to stop chasing Fred when he doesn't have a foolproof way to bring him down.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/3cacc246-b6d3-4d37-89a0-1f56ea407844.png><p>Chip, however, is unsure of how successful lying in wait will be and so when Maggie approaches him for a quote about Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) joining the team, he reveals to her about there being a possibility for a bigger story, if she were interested.</p><p>He doesn't see how dangerous it might be for him to let Fred see his cards, so he tells her Fred was one of the many people who were complicit in Mitch Kessler's (Steve Carrell) behavior. Here's where it gets interesting. New York Times reporter Maggie is portrayed to be a smart reporter who can see through Alex Levy's (Jennifer Aniston) attempts at painting Bradley as someone she gave a chance to.</p><p>So, when Chip gives her an in such as this, she is certain he has someone's support at the network and having an understanding of how UBA's top executive positions stand at the moment, she has a clue who it is. She says so to Chip. That's when Chip realizes how much trouble he is in.&nbsp;</p><p>Chip doesn't understand that Cory is already trying to stop Tate from replacing Chip. Cory is not someone that Fred chose, but he is the man that the board of directors of UBA chose to steer the network on a different path.</p><p>Of course, Cory has his own motives behind supporting Chip and Bradley and finding the truth behind this is going to be fascinating. For now, we wonder what Cory has planned to keep Chip by his side.&nbsp;</p><p>The next episode of 'The Morning Show' will air on December 6 on Apple TV+.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJiaeq670aegp59dqLWww4yep6Krn5myboOMq5yvoZWserOxwpqnZpuYnr1uv8%2BemKSrXaKuqLPInmSnsaRiv6a8zqurnqpdmLyzxYyeo6Who6S7brnOraCvnV2bv6aw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-fleischman-said-that-he-wants-to-end-his-life-through-assisted-suicide.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Fleischman Said That He Wants To End His Life Through Assisted Suicide</span></a>
