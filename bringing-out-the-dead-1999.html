Three days in Frank's life.</p><p>The first day his co-pilot is Larry (<a href=#>John Goodman</a>), who deals with the grief by focusing on where his next meal is coming from. To Larry, it's a job, and you can't let it get to you. Day two, Frank works with Marcus (<a href=#>Ving Rhames</a>), who is a gospel Christian and uses emergencies as an opportunity to demonstrate the power of Jesus; bringing one man back to life, he presents it as a miracle. He drives as if he hopes to arrive at the scene of an accident by causing it. On the third day, the day Christ rose from the dead, Frank's partner is Walls (<a href=#>Tom Sizemore</a>), who is coming apart at the seams and wreaks havoc on hapless patients.</p><p>Haunting Frank's thoughts as he cruises with these guys are two women. One is Rose, whose face peers up at him from every street corner. The other is Mary (<a href=#>Patricia Arquette</a>), the daughter of the man who liked Sinatra. After her dad is transferred to an intensive care unit, his life, such as it is, consists of dying and being shocked back to life, 14 times one day, until Frank asks, "If he gets out, are you gonna follow him around with a defibrillator?" Mary is a former druggie, now clean and straight, and Frank--well, I was going to say he loves her, but this isn't one of those autopilot movies where the action hero has a romance in between the bloodshed. No, it's not love, it's need. He thinks they can save each other.</p><p>Scorsese assembles the film as levels in an inferno. It contains some of his most brilliant sequences, particularly two visits to a high-rise drug house named the Oasis, where a dealer named Cy (<a href=#>Cliff Curtis</a>) offers relief and surcease. Mary goes there one night when she cannot stand any more pain, and Frank follows to save her; that sets up a later sequence in which Frank treats Cy while he is dangling near death.</p><p>All suffering ends at the same place, the emergency room of Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy (nickname: Perpetual Misry) where the receiving nurse (<a href=#>Mary Beth Hurt</a>) knows most of the regulars by name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bqaKml567qHnOrqtmrJiaeqWxwJ1kanFpbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-things-you-didnt-know-about-gloria-borger-html.html><span>←</span><span>8 Things You Didnt Know about Gloria Borger</span></a>
