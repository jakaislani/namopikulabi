Nandini, in particular, seems more like an emotionally complex character in “Ponniyin Selvan: Part II” than she did in the last movie.</description></item><item><title>SZA Postpones Philly Show, Headliner Omar Apollo Still Performs</title><link>/640102-sza-postpones-philly-show-headliner-omar-apollo-still-performs.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/640102-sza-postpones-philly-show-headliner-omar-apollo-still-performs.html</guid><description>On February 21st, SZA commenced her SOS Tour, so far hitting seven cities including Boston, Chicago, and Denver.
