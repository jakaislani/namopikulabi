Particularly, polyphenols like the catechin EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) found in matcha are thought to confer anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and metabolic benefits.<h2>How do you know if green tea has EGCG?</h2>Catechins and Caffein. Catechins are generally more astringent while caffein has more sharp bitterness on your tongue. You can easily taste this from pure caffein powder. Astringency of catechins and EGCg in high concentration taste more like unripe fruits that gives unpleasant feeling in your mouth.<h2>What foods are high in EGCG?</h2>Though EGCG is predominantly found in green tea, it also exists in small amounts in other foods, such as (3): Tea: green, white, oolong, and black teas.
