Recommended Videos Sure, those who count themselves as Marvel fans above all else might feel slightly shortchanged by the singular announcement for that side of the crossover, but quality over quantity couldn’t be truer for the web slinger, who looks every bit as sleek and nimble as you’d expect of the superhero."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

As expected of the Final Fight mainstay, Haggar utilizes his impressive bulk to overpower opponents, at one point in the trailer taking Frank West for a sky-high spin, only to bring him crashing back down to earth with a brutal piledriver.</p><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>Likewise, Nemesis is equally as intimidating, though he looks to be largely unchanged from MvC3. Admittedly, he had the briefest screen time of all the characters, so there should still be plenty to see in regards to Resident Evil 3‘s big nasty. On the other hand, despite him largely being considered a joke character, Mr. West appears to have been given the biggest overhaul of the four, his new super ability a fantastic homage to <a href=#>Dead Rising</a>‘s wacky weapon combo system.</p><p data-characters=83 data-current-count=83 data-injectable=false><strong>Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite</strong> is out September 19 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZopJqqppq5bq%2FAqZqopV2eu6e1zaKrnmWXlrqmvMuasGabn6Ozqr7MrGSsqJmZsrO5wKdkn6qRo7huw8Ssq2amlaKytLXSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jc-mason-net-worth-246899.html><span>←</span><span>JC Mason Net Worth</span></a>
