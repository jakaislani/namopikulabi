<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Tokyo Story movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1953)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There is great sadness, of course, and sympathy for the old father. But life must go on. The children were casually indifferent to their parents in life. Now that the mother is dead, they speak of their regrets that they didn't do more for her; but they also maneuver quietly for some of her possessions, and within a day after the funeral they have all returned to the city, leaving the father alone.</p><p>Of all the relatives, the one who is most considerate of the father is not even a blood relative: a daughter-in-law, the widow of a son who died, was the warmest toward the old couple when they were in Tokyo, and now she is the kindest to the old man. He tells her, after his wife's funeral, that she should remarry as soon as possible. "My son is dead," he says, "and it is not right for you not to marry." He says he would feel better if she forgot his son; he does not see any irony in this attitude, so soon after his wife's funeral, and perhaps there really isn't any.</p><p>"Tokyo Story" was made in 1953, or at about the same period that a group of great Japanese films was beginning to make a first impression on Western audiences. The best known are "<a href=#>Rashomon</a>," "Ugetsu Monogatari" and "Gates of Hell." But "Tokyo Story" was not imported at that time, and its current national release represents a kind of posthumous tribute to Ozu.</p><p>It is clear that "Tokyo Story" was one of the unacknowledged masterpieces of the early-1950s Japanese cinema, and that Ozu has more than a little in common with that other great director, <a href=#>Kenji Mizoguchi</a> ("<a href=#>Ugetsu</a>"). Both of them use their cameras as largely impassive, honest observers. Both seem reluctant to manipulate the real time in which their scenes are acted; Ozu uses very restrained editing, and Mizoguchi often shoots scenes in unbroken takes.</p><p>This objectivity creates an interesting effect; because we are not being manipulated by devices of editing and camera movement, we do not at first have any very strong reaction to "Tokyo Story." We miss the visual cues and shorthand used by Western directors to lead us by the nose. With Ozu, it's as if the characters are living their lives unaware that a movie is being shot. And so we get to know them gradually, begin to look for personal characteristics and to understand the implications of little gestures and quiet remarks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tpqSxn2LAtbvRsmRqcWVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rapidus-to-get-39-billion-in-government-aid-for-2nm-multichiplet-technologies.html><span>←</span><span>Rapidus to Get $3.9 Billion in Government Aid for 2nm, Multi-Chiplet Technologies</span></a>
