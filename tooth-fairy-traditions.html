Saturday we went on the Polar Express train ride. While we were in line, Reece made friends with this other 5 year old standing next to us. One of the topics was teeth. This other little boy had already lost several teeth and his mom was saying that he had swallowed his first one.</p><img data-perfmatters-preload decoding=async border=0 height=143 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tooth-Fairy-Traditions-1.jpg width=200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>A couple minutes later Reece turns to me with his finger in his mouth telling me he has a loose tooth. I kind of ignore him but Reece keeps on insisting so I take a look-see and by golly it‚Äôs super loose! So that night, and the next, he‚Äôs super nervous about swallowing his tooth in his sleep and I‚Äôm all stressed out because my baby is losing his first tooth and I feel totally unprepared.</p><p><img decoding=async border=0 height=200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tooth-Fairy-Traditions-2.jpg width=199 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Well Sunday and Monday go by and nothing. Tuesday morning he eats his breakfast (cereal) and then goes and gets dressed. He starts telling me about something and as he‚Äôs talking I‚Äôm thinking something looks different. ‚ÄúReece‚Äù, I say, ‚Äúopen your mouth for Mommy‚Äù. His tooth is <b><span>GONE</span></b>.</p><p>We search high and low for it and finally accept the fact that he swallowed it with breakfast. He goes to his room to write a note to The Tooth Fairy and I clean up after breakfast. On an impulse, I decide to look in his bowl of leftover milk and lo and behold I find his little tiny tooth! Seriously unbelievable!</p><img decoding=async border=0 height=143 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tooth-Fairy-Traditions-3.jpg width=200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>This is his letter. I had him read it to me and I wrote a translation below. It says:<br><i><span><b>Dear Tooth Fairy,</b></span></i><br><i><span><b>I don‚Äôt want a toothbrush. I just want a regular present.&nbsp;</b></span></i><br><i><span><b>Thanks,</b></span></i><br><i><span><b>Reece &nbsp;</b></span></i><br><i><span><b>Good-bye</b></span></i><br>I think it‚Äôs funny that he traded in a toothbrush for a ‚Äúregular present‚Äù. I wrapped up a Transformer that he was going to get for Christmas and it just made his morning.</p><img decoding=async border=0 height=320 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tooth-Fairy-Traditions-4.jpg width=248 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>My Mom (<span><b>cause she was the bestest</b></span>) used to make a big deal out of everything. I always felt so special growing up and I wanted to do for Reece what my Mom did for me. Every time we lost a tooth, she would write a note from The Tooth Fairy to us. She made each letter all squiggly and it was just so darn cool. I did the same for Reece. Red is his favorite color üôÇ</p><p><h5>free email course</h5><h4><strong>5 SECRETS</strong> TO GETTING DINNER ON THE TABLE...<strong>FAST!</strong></h4></p><p>What do you do for your kids? Do you have Tooth Fairy traditions? We got money as kids and that‚Äôs what I was planning on giving Reece until he wrote up his little letter. Hey, I‚Äôm flexible. I‚Äôm still adjusting to the fact that I am old enough to be the mother of a child who just lost his tooth. I know, I‚Äôll get over it üôÇ</p><p><img decoding=async border=0 height=200 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tooth-Fairy-Traditions-5.jpg width=142 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><i>Linking up&nbsp;<a href=#>here</a>&nbsp;and Home Stories A2Z&nbsp;<a href=# class=external rel=nofollow>Tutorials and Tips</a></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvMqKWtoZ2avLbAjZympmekpLy1tIyfmKKqqWLBs63Doquip56ofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patrick-mahomes-ii.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Patrick Mahomes II Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
