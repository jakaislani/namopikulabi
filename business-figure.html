Two years later, he was conscripted for National Service but discharged after he was deemed emotionally and mentally unfit. Brian was then put in charge of another branch of the family business, which they called&nbsp;North End Music Stores (NEMS),&nbsp;where he thrived as a natural-born salesman. However, after pleading with his parents, Brian joined the Royal Academy for Dramatic Arts to train as an actor, but returned to the family business after realizing he wasn't cut out for show business.</p><p>When his father opened a new store on Great Charlotte St, Brian was put in charge of the ground floor, where he expanded to selling records and became heavily involved in the local music scene.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=brian-epstein-discovers-the-beatles>Brian Epstein Discovers The Beatles</h2><p>Credited by many with discovering the Beatles, Brian was managing his family's Liverpool record store when he first heard the band.&nbsp;He became the group's manager in 1962 and secured deals for them with Decca and Parlophone records.
