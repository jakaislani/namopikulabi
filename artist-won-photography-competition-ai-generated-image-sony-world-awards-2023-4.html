Her dress also appears to blend into her arm.</p><p class=premium>"It has all the flaws of AI, and it could have been spotted but it wasn't," Eldagsen told Insider, adding that he was surprised the image won. After hearing of his success in early March, he immediately told the competition's organizers that the image was AI-generated, he said.</p><p class=premium>AI image-generation sites such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion have boomed in popularity over recent months. In their prompts, users can ask the sites to create artwork&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>in the style of a particular artist</a> or images of events that never happened — leading to deepfake images of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link data-analytics-post-depth=40 data-uri=c9f3ef7fd270d66168dadfd0ce948bf9>former President Donald Trump being arrested</a>&nbsp;going viral. Users can also ask the platforms to edit existing images.</p><p class="content-recommendations-title headline-bold ignore-typography">Related stories</p><p class=premium>Eldagsen told Insider that he generated the image in September using DALL-E 2 in a process he referred to as "promptography."</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>"For me, working with AI image generators is a co-creation, in which I am the director," he wrote on his website. "It is not about pressing a button – and done it is. It is about exploring the complexity of this process, starting with refining text prompts, then developing a complex workflow, and mixing various platforms and techniques."</p><p class=premium>Eldagsen told Insider that he wanted to start a conversation around the relationship between AI and photography. Competition organizers should create separate categories for AI-generated art, which is becoming increasingly realistic, he said.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Some of the images Boris Eldagsen generated with DALL-E 2 in the process of creating "The Electrician." <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Boris Eldagsen with DALL-E 2.

The category now does not have a winner.</p><p class=premium>"While elements of AI practices are relevant in artistic contexts of image-making, the Awards always have been and will continue to be a platform for championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium," the spokesperson added.</p><p class=premium>"The Electrician" is part of a series by Eldagsen called "pseudomnesia," the Latin term for "fake memory." The images are "fake memories of a past, that never existed, that no-one photographed," created by putting them through AI image generators between 20 and 40 times, Eldagsen <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>says on his website</a>.</p><p>Advertisement</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Images from Boris Eldagsen's "pseudomnesia" series. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Boris Eldagsen with DALL-E 2.
