If you like hummus, I have a feeling you’ll love this Mediterranean eggplant dip too. Made with grilled or roasted eggplant, tahini, garlic, and lemon, it’s creamy, smoky, nutty, and bright. I’m sharing my easy baba ganoush recipe below. It pairs perfectly with crisp veggies and pita bread, but I love it so much that I’ve also been known to eat it straight off a spoon. I hope you enjoy it too! How to Make Baba Ganoush This baba ganoush recipe is simple to make.

Maybe fruity, maybe frozen, and definitely refreshing, these drinks will help you cool off and celebrate the season all in one. Below, you’ll find the easy cocktail recipes I’ll be making all summer. Perfect for any occasion from a neighborhood BBQ to a laid-back evening at home, they include fruity margaritas, bubbly spritzes, non-alcoholic refreshers, and more. I’d have a hard time choosing a favorite from these festive summer drinks. I hope you love them too! Our Best Summer Cocktails Paloma Cocktail Jack and I make this tequila cocktail every summer.

At this time of year, I can’t get enough of salads made with peak-season fruits and veggies. I especially love a good sweet and salty combination. This watermelon salad with feta, cucumber, mint, and a tangy lime dressing is exactly that. The recipe takes minutes to throw together, and it’s incredibly refreshing. Try it once, and—if you’re anything like me—you’ll have it on repeat for the rest of watermelon season. Watermelon Salad Recipe Ingredients If you’ve never tried watermelon in a savory setting, you have to make this…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I think my love of seasonal cooking comes from all the corn on the cob I ate as a kid. In the summer, my mom served boiled corn on the cob with dinner almost every night. She’d pick it up from a farm stand nearby, so it was always super-sweet and fresh. I couldn’t get enough of it – the juicy, golden kernels coated in butter and sprinkled with salt. To this day, the thought of that summer sweet corn makes my mouth start watering. I’ve posted recipes for steamed corn on the cob and grilled corn on the cob…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s no secret that I love gazpacho. Over the years, I’ve shared a gazpacho recipe with watermelon, one with corn, another with carrots, and still another with tangy tomatillos. What can I say? On a hot summer day, there’s no better way to cool off than with cold soup. If you’re not familiar with gazpacho, it’s a chilled soup that originated in Andalucía, Spain. Traditional recipes call for tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, and bread, which thickens the soup. This recipe isn’t entirely authentic, but it has a lot in common with Spanish gazpacho. Tomatoes, cucumber, and…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>A ranch water cocktail is the perfect drink for a hot summer day. We’re leaving for a quick trip to Austin tomorrow, and I know I’ll order a ranch water (or two) while we’re there. This combination of tequila, lime juice, and fizzy Topo Chico over ice is the best way to beat the Texas heat. When we’re not in Austin, I love to make this ranch water recipe at home.&nbsp;Made with 3 ingredients, it couldn’t be simpler, and it’s cooling, refreshing, and not too sweet. Try it once, and it might just become your favorite summer drink! Ranch Water…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Grilled corn on the cob is one of the highlights of summer. It’s sweet and juicy, with a satisfying crunch and smoky char from the hot grill grates. It’ll be on the menu at every BBQ and cookout I host for the next few months, and I hope you’re planning to make it for all your get-togethers too. Fresh corn season will be gone before we know it! Let’s enjoy it while we can. Below, I’m sharing two methods for how to grill corn on the cob—in the husk and out. The first method yields super-juicy, bright yellow kernels, while…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This red sangria recipe is perfect for summer entertaining! It’s cool, fruity, and refreshing (and it makes a whole pitcher). As cocktails go, it’s inexpensive and easy to make. What better drink to share with friends on a hot day? Red Sangria Ingredients Here’s what you’ll need to make this easy sangria recipe: Red wine – I use a Spanish red wine such as Tempranillo or Garnacha.

Delicious is an understatement, if you ask me. Many grilled potato recipes instruct you to grill the potatoes in foil packets. After using that method for years, I finally tried putting the potatoes directly on the grill grates. Once I did, I never looked back. These grilled potatoes have crispier skins and a smokier flavor. When I’m making grilled potatoes, that’s exactly what I’m after.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Bring on the summer desserts!&nbsp;I don’t know about you, but I’m ready for frozen treats like ice cream and popsicles. I’m ready for no-bake sweets that hit the spot on days when it’s too hot to use the oven. And I’m especially&nbsp;ready for summer desserts that showcase the season’s best fruit. Cherry pie? Peach crisp? Blueberry cobbler? Yes, please! You’ll find 30 of my favorite easy summer desserts below.&nbsp;Some are perfect for packing up for picnics. Others are designed to help you cool off on hot days, and still others are celebration-worthy centerpieces like pies, cakes, and tarts.

I love them because they’re the perfect last-minute appetizer for gatherings—flavorful, elegant, and SO easy to throw together. Jack and Ollie love them…well…because they love anything with cheese. The recipe is super simple. I marinate mini fresh mozzarella balls in olive oil with herbs, garlic, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes. The bright, savory flavor of the fresh garlic, lemon, and herbs saturates the oil, which in turn soaks into the chewy balls of cheese. I hope these marinated mozzarella balls become your go-to appetizer for parties and gatherings,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJnopqwqrzEZqCnnJWterO7zq1mnaGVqXyouNStnKdllqeypns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anya-chalotra-5.html><span>←</span><span>Anya Chalotra Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
