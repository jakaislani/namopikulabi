When we first planted our lemon tree, I had this romantic idea that I’d be able to pick fresh lemons all year round. Obviously, I’m not good with plants, or I would have known that the famous saying is literally true. You get lemons once a year, and you get a lot of them. Needless to say, life has been lemony lately in many ways, but today it’s all about these lovely lemon shortbread cookies.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/lemon-shortbread-cookies/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC03659.jpg&description=These+Lemon+Shortbread+Cookies+are+a+great+addition+to+a+holiday+cookie+plate%2C+but+I+love+to+make+them+at+all+times+of+year.+Fresh+thyme+leaves+and+lemon+zest+give+them+a+delightful%2C+refreshing+lemon+flavor.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons")'></span></span></p><h2>Lemon Shortbread Cookies Ingredients</h2><p>When I was testing this recipe, I made a ton of lemon shortbread cookies. I tried vegan and gluten-free shortbread cookies recipes with different oils and flours, all sorts of things. During the process, I was stressing out. Some cookies were dry, some were burned, and some flattened out like pancakes (not the good kind). I’m just lucky that Jack, being the kind taste tester that he is, made sure not a crumb went to waste.</p><p>So what did I end up with? A straightforward, delightful lemon butter cookie recipe. Here’s what’s in it:</p><ul><li><strong>All-purpose flour</strong> – Sometimes complicated problems demand simple solutions. I tried all sorts of flours in this recipe, but good old AP yielded the best results every time.</li><li><strong>Butter</strong> – It gives these lemon shortbread cookies a delicious buttery flavor and melt-in-your-mouth texture.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong> – For sweetness.</li><li><strong>Lemon juice and zest</strong> – You couldn’t make lemon shortbread cookies without them! They fill these treats with bright lemon flavor.</li><li><strong>Fresh thyme</strong> – My twist. 🙂 I adore the combination of lemon and thyme in these cookies. It’s so surprising and refreshing; I think you’re going to love it too!</li><li><strong>And sea salt</strong> – To make all the flavors pop!</li></ul><p>Find the complete recipe with measurements below.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/lemon-shortbread-cookies/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC03693.jpg&description=These+Lemon+Shortbread+Cookies+are+a+great+addition+to+a+holiday+cookie+plate%2C+but+I+love+to+make+them+at+all+times+of+year.+Fresh+thyme+leaves+and+lemon+zest+give+them+a+delightful%2C+refreshing+lemon+flavor.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons")'></span></span></p><h2>How to Make Lemon Shortbread Cookies</h2><p>The recipe is pretty simple and straightforward. Here’s how it goes:</p><p><strong>First, make the dough.</strong> Cream the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the sugar and beat until fluffy, followed by the lemon juice, zest, and thyme. Mix again. Then, add the flour and salt and mix until just combined.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/lemon-shortbread-cookies/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC03759.jpg&description=These+Lemon+Shortbread+Cookies+are+a+great+addition+to+a+holiday+cookie+plate%2C+but+I+love+to+make+them+at+all+times+of+year.+Fresh+thyme+leaves+and+lemon+zest+give+them+a+delightful%2C+refreshing+lemon+flavor.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons")'></span></span></p><p>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and flatten it into a 1″ disk. If it’s sticky, wrap it up and chill it for 15 to 30 minutes, or until it’s firm, but still pliable.</p><p><strong>Next, roll out the dough and cut out the cookies. </strong>My favorite part! Aim for the dough to be about 1/4″ thick. Then, use cookie cutters to cut out any shapes you like. Like in my <a href=#>sugar cookie recipe</a>, I recommend starting at the edges of the dough and working inwards, puzzling together the cutters to cut out as many cookies as you can. Transfer the cut-outs to parchment-lined baking sheets, and re-roll the scraps to make more cookies.</p><p><strong>Then, bake!</strong> Transfer the cookies to a 350° preheated oven, and bake until the edges are starting to turn light brown. Transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.</p><p><strong>Finally, share them with someone you love!</strong></p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/lemon-shortbread-cookies/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC03743.jpg&description=These+Lemon+Shortbread+Cookies+are+a+great+addition+to+a+holiday+cookie+plate%2C+but+I+love+to+make+them+at+all+times+of+year.+Fresh+thyme+leaves+and+lemon+zest+give+them+a+delightful%2C+refreshing+lemon+flavor.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons")'></span></span></p><h2>Lemon Shortbread Cookies Tips</h2><ul><li><strong>Use softened – not melted – butter.</strong> The first step of this recipe, creaming the butter, is what gives these cookies their perfect light texture. In order to cream the butter, it needs to be soft, but not melted. To soften your butter, you’re going to need to plan ahead. Remove it from the fridge, set it on the counter, and let it sit for a couple of hours while it comes to room temperature. We’ve all tried to speed up this process in the microwave, but take it from me: letting your butter soften at room temperature will always yield the best results.</li><li><strong>Bake one sheet at a time. </strong>Temperatures vary throughout an oven, so baking one sheet at a time is the best way to ensure that your cookies cook evenly. You don’t want ones on the bottom rack to burn before the top rack starts to brown! Pop any cut-outs that don’t make it onto the first sheet in the fridge until you’re ready to bake them.</li><li><strong>Pair them with a cup of coffee or tea.</strong> Who doesn’t love a hot beverage and a sweet treat on a cold day? The thyme and lemon flavor makes these cookies especially delicious with tea, but they pair nicely with coffee and <a href=#>hot chocolate</a> too. Enjoy!</li></ul><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/lemon-shortbread-cookies/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_2016_12_10_09079-cropped.jpg&description=These+Lemon+Shortbread+Cookies+are+a+great+addition+to+a+holiday+cookie+plate%2C+but+I+love+to+make+them+at+all+times+of+year.+Fresh+thyme+leaves+and+lemon+zest+give+them+a+delightful%2C+refreshing+lemon+flavor.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons")'></span></span></p><h2>More Favorite Cookie Recipes</h2><p>If you love these lemon thyme shortbread cookies, try one of these cookies next:</p><ul><li><a href=#>Vegan Sugar Cookies</a></li><li><a href=#>Lemon Cookies</a></li><li><a href=#>Perfect Oatmeal Cookies</a></li><li><a href=#>Best Peanut Butter Cookies</a></li><li><a href=#>Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies</a></li><li><a href=#>Tahini Cookies</a></li><li><a href=#>No Bake Cookies</a></li><li><a href=#>Orange Zest Shortbread Cookies</a></li></ul><p><span id=more-26562></span><br></p><span class=rating><span class=average itemprop=ratingValue>4.9</span> from <span class=count itemprop=ratingCount>56</span> reviews</span><h2 itemprop=name class=ERSName>Lemon Shortbread Cookies</h2>&nbsp; <img decoding=async itemprop=image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_2016_12_10_09097-69x100.jpg width=205 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span class=ERSPrintBtnSpan><a class=ERSPrintBtn href=# rel=nofollow>Print</a></span>Prep time 45 minsCook time 10 minsTotal time 55 mins&nbsp;These Lemon Shortbread Cookies are a delightful addition to a holiday cookie plate, but I love making them at all times of year.
