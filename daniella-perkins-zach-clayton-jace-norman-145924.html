Now, the show isn't coming out until 2018 ‚Äì but we are already low-key (er, high-key) obsessed. Why? Because the cast is so lit. Just take <a href=#>Daniella Perkins</a>, for example.</p><p>The 17-year-old actress is about to become a very familiar face on Nickelodeon, but <a href=#>Girl Meets World</a> superfans might also remember her from starring in an episode of the Disney Channel fave. It is safe to say she's already super tight with the Nick fam. However, she's also had to deal with a big dose of drama not too long ago ‚Äì&nbsp;and it involves her co-star <a href=#>Jace Norman</a>. Yep, that's right. The two are actually starring in a new movie together called Blurt alongside <a href=#>JoJo Siwa</a>.</p><p></p><p>But turns out, with spending time together came some drama for Jace and Daniella. We chatted with each of the stars, and they filled us in on what really happened. But first, let's give you a refresher of the background info.</p><p>Even though Daniella's <a href=#>breakup with web star Zach Clayton</a> (who previously dated <a href=#>Baby Ariel</a>) was pretty recent, it's not getting the best of her. The actress shared her advice on dating in the public eye, as her experience taught how to deal with drama. You see, back in September, Daniella and Zach went public about their breakup ‚Äì&nbsp;but Zach's tweets sparked rumors that the <a href=#>Henry Danger</a> star had something to do with their split. After the tweets, Daniella immediately took to her Instagram Stories to <a href=#>shut down rumors that she cheated</a>, and now she is totally moving on with a positive attitude.</p><p>"I think there should be some things that you keep just private in between you two so the outside doesn‚Äôt really get that involved ‚Äì&nbsp;because sometimes people take it to another level, and things could happen," Daniella exclusively told J-14. "My life motto is to stay positive about everything and stay true to yourself. You‚Äôll be okay with any drama that goes on, as long as you know who you are."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i'm not gonna disrespect dani cause i would never do her like that<br>But if he wants to keep throwing shots at me I AM RIGHT HERE READY</p><p>‚Äî spooky zach (@badzachx) <a href=#>September 9, 2017</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>what's up henry danger, nickelodeon called you already and said to not say anything? think twice before stepping between pops relationships</p><p>‚Äî spooky zach (@badzachx) <a href=#>September 10, 2017</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i'm done with all this drama i forgot i'm supposed to be an unproblematic child ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èso no more fighting and arguing , just drop it‚ù§Ô∏èwe good</p><p>‚Äî spooky zach (@badzachx) <a href=#>September 10, 2017</a></p><p>"Everyone breaks up ‚Äì like it's a thing that happens in life. It's not like a huge thing, but being [on] the internet ‚Äì things are going to happen, of course, if you have a really have following or something, it‚Äôs expected ‚Äì especially being a public relationship," the star continued. "Things happen, and I‚Äôm busy with work now."</p><p>When we caught up with Jace, he confirmed that all of this drama truly did come out of no where ‚Äì and he really felt bad that Daniella had to put up with it.</p><p>"I'm usually a pretty low-key guy and I've never been hit with that much attention," he exclusively told us. "I didn't know who he was. I didn't know what was going on, but his fans are very passionate. There was a hashtag trending or something. That was an interesting night for me. I definitely saw the power of social media in a negative way. I tried to move on. I tried not to reply. I tried to just let it blow over. It's all good. I was more concerned about Daniella 'cause she was the one who was getting accused of a lot of things. I was more focused on her because, for me, Zach was just going after and trying to get some attention for me. I was just trying to stay low-key and protect Dani."</p><p>Jace went on to explain how it felt experiencing a snippet of the crazy side of fame in this unfortunate situation. In fact, it made him think about the things other famous people like <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> have to deal with.</p><p>"I'm obviously not as big as Justin Bieber, but I can't imagine what he goes through. I have a lot of sympathy for him. You live in this world where you can't really be a human being ‚Äì you have to be this person, this image. That can really destroy you from the inside out because at the end of the day, we're humans, we have a soul, and we're sensitive and stuff like that."</p><p>Dating in the public eye is one thing, but just living your everyday life is even strange at times for famous people like Justin and Jace. That's why Jace gets it that celebs end up dating other celebs.</p><p>"You go places and people talk at you. You know what I mean? Not to you. And they kind of look at you like you're this thing," Jace spilled. "After a while, you just want something genuine and something normal. A lot of times, that's why these celebrities they start dating other celebrities because they get it. They're in the same boat."</p><p>We can all take a lesson from Daniella and Jace's mature way of handling this.</p><p>This post was originally published on November 3, 2017 and since has been updated.</p><p><strong>Watch the video below to see us chatting all things Knight Squad and more with Daniella.</strong></p><p>Love J-14?
