The post surprised many online users, with many scrutinizing every detail of the image to see if it was genuine.</p><h2>“From Queen to Goddess,” netizens said of Martha Stewart’s Snoop Dogg tattoo</h2><p>When Martha Stewart tweeted a photo of herself with Snoop Dogg ink, netizens rushed to express their thoughts and respond. Stewart was dubbed a “bad*ss” and a “true gangster” by many. Others were taken aback and commented on the two celebrities’ strong bond. Many people questioned whether the tattoo was genuine or just for the Super Bowl ad.</p><h2>For nearly a decade, Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart have been pals</h2><p>In 2008, Stewart invited the rapper to her culinary program, and the two quickly became friends. Dogg quickly became a fixture on the show. Both are constantly flattering of one another, with the Drop It Like Its Hot singer admitting that he told everyone they were best friends. They have, however, never dated.</p><p>In an interview with Rolling Stone, Dogg stated:</p><p><strong>“I’ve never met anyone who even comes close to Martha Stewart.
