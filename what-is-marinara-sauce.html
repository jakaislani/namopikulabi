Luckily for you, I decided to go a bit more in depth and talk about the popular Italian red sauce. Plus, I think I just read an article in Vogue that the “red splotched” look is making a comeback, so I better keep those shirts around.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-marinara-sauce><strong>What is marinara sauce?</strong></h2><p>Marinara sauce is typically a simple red sauce made with tomatoes and various aromatic ingredients such as onions and garlic. Sometimes it’s jazzed up with stuff like olives, capers, and even a splash of wine. It’s served hot over pasta or, if you’re lucky, in a styrofoam cup for dipping mozzarella sticks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-marinara-sauce-the-same-as-spaghetti-sauce><strong>Is marinara sauce the same as spaghetti sauce?</strong></h2><p>Marinara is typically a simple tomato sauce. Spaghetti sauce, however, usually implies that a little something extra has been added, like meat or vegetables. But that begs the question…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-can-i-use-marinara-sauce-for-spaghetti><strong>Can I use marinara sauce for spaghetti?</strong></h2><p>Yes, absolutely. In fact, in central Italy there’s a spaghetti sauce based on the Americanized version of marinara called “sugo finto”…but you will have to live with the fact that it translates literally to “fake sauce.” Who knew Italy was so tough on poseurs!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-marinara-pizza-sauce><strong>Is marinara pizza sauce?</strong></h2><p>Pizza sauce and marinara sauce are similar but not the same. Pizza sauce is thicker in consistency than marinara sauce because the tomatoes are pureed instead of lightly blended.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-do-you-make-marinara-sauce><strong>How do you make marinara sauce?</strong></h2><p>Well, there are a thousand different ways, but if I were to boil it down to the simplest recipe:</p><p>First, thing’s first: Put on chef’s hat.&nbsp;</p><p>After you’ve done that, bring tomatoes (use the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best canned tomatoes</a>) and an entire half of an onion to a simmer and let sit on low heat for at least 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Take the pot off the heat, remove the onion, and add garlic while smooshing any errant tomato chunks to your liking. Add salt to taste. Acquire job as professional cook in an authentic Italian eatery. Get own show on Food Network. Leave life as you know it behind and enjoy new career as top dog of the culinary elite. Mangia!&nbsp;</p><p>But, that’s just the recipe I tend to use, like I said…there are a thousand different variations. I’ve just found this one works for me, personally. Of course, you could also just open a jar of store bought marinara sauce. Just make sure it’s the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best store bought marinara</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BEST-JARRED-MARINARA-RANKING_DANNY-PALUMBO_SPORKED_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-best-marinara-sauce>Best Marinara Sauce</h2><p>Now that you know all about marinara sauce, find out what the best jarred marinara sauce is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmpJqqmaOus62MrJium5Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juice-wrld-birthday-and-death-date.html><span>←</span><span>Juice Wrld Birthday and Death Date: How fans Gave Tribute to him on his 24th Birthday?</span></a>
