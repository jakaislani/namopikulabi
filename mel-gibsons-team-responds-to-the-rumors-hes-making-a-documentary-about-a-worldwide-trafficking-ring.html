I am personally grateful for his support as we worked on this documentary, however reports this four-part series is actually being produced by Mr. Gibson are not accurate. It’s being produced by Nick Nanton of DNA Films and includes several executive producers such as Kyle Cease, Tony and Sage Robbins and other wonderful and talented people.”</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>In short; Gibson has been involved with the organization in the past, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but he’s not taking on any creative or behind-the-camera duties on this project</a>.
