The chip uses two of the Zen 2 eight-core chiplets, paired with an IO die that provides 24 total PCIe 4.0 lanes. By using the AM4 socket, AMD recommends pairing the Ryzen 9 3950X with one of the new X570 motherboards launched at Computex.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/14516/IMG_20190529_101601_678x452_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>With regards to performance, AMD is promoting it as a clear single-thread and multi-thread improvement over other 16-core products in the market, particularly those from Intel (namely the 7960X).</p><p>There are several questions surrounding this new product, such as reasons for the delay between the initial Ryzen 3000 launch to the 3950X launch, the power distribution of the chiplets based on the frequency and how the clocks will respond to the 105W TDP, how the core-to-core communications will work going across chiplets, and how gaming performance might be affected by the latency differences going to the IO die and then moving off to main memory. All these questions are expected to be answered in due course.</p><p>Pricing is set to be announced by AMD at its event at E3 today. We’ll be updating this news post when we know the intended pricing.</p><p>Update: $749</p><h3>Related Reading</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH51gZBvZpqllGJ%2Bd3nCqKmeZaKux6a6jHJkbHFlZcVuwc9mq6hlZGKEbrPHs2RqaGWseqS7zKKloGWjmr21scybnKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./max-homa-lacey-croom-wedding-meet-the-golf-couple-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Max Homa Lacey Croom Wedding: Meet The Golf Couple On Instagram</span></a>
