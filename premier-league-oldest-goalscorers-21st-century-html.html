From there, he got promoted to Scunthorpe&nbsp;United first team and then went on to play for a few other teams in England, such as Luton, Preston North End, and Burnley. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And it was at Burnely that the now-retired right-back scored the goal that made him one of the oldest goalscorers in the league for this century.</p><p>In a Premier League match between Hull City and Burnley FC during the 2009/10 league season, Alexander achieved this record.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the match, Hull City got thrashed 1:4 at home by Burnley, and Alexander scored two of those four goals, one in the 64th minute and another in the 70th, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He was 38 years and six months old at the time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, he scored another goal after these, too, which in turn made him the oldest goalscorer in Burnley’s history, but the goal was in the FA Cup and not in the Premier League.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Stuart Pearce, Defender</h2><p>Stuart Pearce is the fourth-oldest player to score a goal in the Premier League. The former West Ham United and Manchester City player achieved this milestone while playing for West Ham United during the 2000/01 Premier League season. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In matchday 15 of the 2000/01 Premier League season, Southampton FC were to play West Ham United at home.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">clash </a>between 15th and 11th placed teams ended in a 2:3 away win for West Ham. Among the three goals, one was Pearce’s long-distance goal that made him one of the oldest to score a goal in the PL.</p><p>Pearce scored this goal on November 25, 2000, at the age of 38 years, seven months, and one day.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Stuart is also the second-oldest scorer in the club’s history, just behind Teddy Sherringham.</p><h2>Ryan Giggs</h2><p>Ryan Giggs is a Manchester United legend through and through. However, he actually started his career playing for Manchester City’s youth team.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In November of 1987, he went from City’s youth team to United’s youth team.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Post his move to United, Giggs never played for any other team.</p><p>In the Premier League alone, Giggs made 632 appearances for the Red Devils and scored 109 goals.&nbsp;And the last of them made him the third-oldest player to get on the scoresheet in the PL this century.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This goal, which also made the Welshman the oldest to score for Manchester United, came in a 0:2 away win against Queens Park Rangers on February 23,&nbsp;2013.</p><p>The goal was also the last he ever scored for the club in all competitions. He went goalless in his final season for Man United—the 2013/14 season. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Giggs was 39 years, two months, and 25 days old when he netted for the final time, and he left a record which will be very hard to beat for anyone who plays for Manchester United.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Dean Windass, Striker</h2><p>Dean Windass is the second-oldest player to score a goal in the Premier League in the 21st century. The center-forward played for a lot of clubs during his careers, such as Hull City, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, and&nbsp;Middlesbrough.</p><p>He set this record with Hull City, the club where&nbsp;he made his&nbsp;professional football debut. The goal that he set this record with was his only league goal in the&nbsp;2008/09 season with Hull City.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On November 22, 2008, Hull City played Portsmouth FC in an away game in the PL. The game was nicely poised, with Portsmouth clinching a 2:1 lead until the final 30 minutes.</p><p>Windass, who had started the game on the bench, was brought on in the 73rd minute. And in the 87th minute, he scored the equalizer for Hull City.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>The Englishman was 39 years, seven months, and&nbsp; 21 days old when he netted that strike, which also ended up making him the oldest goalscorer in Hull City’s history. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Teddy Sheringham, Forward</h2><p>Teddy Sheringham is the second West Ham United player to feature in this list after Stuart Pearce. He is the oldest goalscorer in the Premier League since the start of the 21st century.</p><p>The striker played for a lot of top teams in England, such as Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United, and Nottingham Forrest, and also played for Swedish club Djurgarden early in his career.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>However, the goal that made this record came while playing for West Ham in the penultimate season of his professional career: the 2006/07 Premier League season. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On December 26, 2006, West Ham United played Portsmouth FC in the league. Sheringham did not start the game but was brought on at the start of the second half to decrease two goals deficit somehow.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>In the 81st minute, Sheringham scored a goal. However, it was too little too late as his team couldn’t score another one, and West Ham lost the game two goals to one.</p><p>This was his last goal for the club, which he scored at the age of 40 years, eight months, and 24 days.&nbsp;It was also the strike that made him the oldest goalscorer for West Ham United.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwvNGepKKdomK5pq3Grpxmp5yZsrTAjKCmmqSjmLyzsdGsZGtpo6l6pLHNrayrsV6dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dennis-mehiel-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Dennis Mehiel Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
