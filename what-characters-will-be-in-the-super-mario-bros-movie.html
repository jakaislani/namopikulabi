Movie,</a> </strong>but the film will be hitting cinema screens in just over half a year’s time.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>With the recent reveal of the film’s trailer, we thought it would be an opportune time to recap exactly which characters are confirmed to be appearing on the silver screen alongside Mario in what is shaping up to be at the very least, a much less disastrous big screen appearance for Nintendo’s poster boy plumber.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-mario-chris-pratt data-injectable=false><strong>Mario (Chris Pratt)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mario-chris-pratt.png><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>The titular plumber himself, as you almost certainly know, will be played by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jurassic World: Dominion</a> star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Pratt</a>. The internet has been supremely doubtful of this casting choice, with a wide expectation for Pratt to drop the ball with this adaptation. While the trailer revealed that the ball is intact, it’s not exactly rocketing toward success either. Pratt is pretty much just holding it, from what we’ve seen so far.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/princess-peach-anya-taylor-joy.png><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>The generally-in-distress Princess from the video games will be portrayed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anya Taylor-Joy</a>, best known for her role as chess prodigy Beth Harmon in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Queen’s Gambit</a>. While we’re unsure of how Illumination and Nintendo plan to tackle the character of Peach, having not been present in the reveal trailer, we do know Taylor-Joy is a fantastic actress.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Luigi (Charlie Day)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/luigi-charlie-day.png><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>Mario’s taller, sassier brother will be portrayed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a> actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlie Day</a>, portraying an eccentric and sometimes deranged Charlie Kelly on the long-running fan-favorite sitcom. While all we got from Day during the first trailer were a few audible efforts as he runs from a horde of Dry Bones, they certainly sounded like a good fit for the character.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Bowser (Jack Black)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jack-black-bowser-1.png><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>Easily the fan-favorite of the New York Comic Con trailer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Black</a>’s booming and dominant portrayal of Mario’s nemesis is looking to be the absolute highlight of the upcoming movie, should the rest of the cast and overarching story fail to stick the landing. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Black has stellar voice acting chops, given his work on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kung Fu Panda</a> films.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Toad (Keegan-Michael Key)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/toad-keegan-michael-key.png><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>Princess Peach’s attendant and long-time ally to Mario and friends will be portrayed by<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Keegan-Michael Key</a>, co-creator and co-star to Jordan Peele in the sketch series Key & Peele. Key has also appeared alongside Chris Pratt in the past during the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parks & Recreation</a> days as Donna Meagle’s love interest. In the trailer, it is evident Key’s voice has been pitched up a little in post-production, but he’s sounding good.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/donkey-kong-seth-rogen.png><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Another notable absentee from the first trailer was Donkey Kong, played by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Seth Rogen</a>. The actor’s writing and acting credits in the field of comedy are quite extensive, appearing in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pineapple Express</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the End</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sausage Party</a>, just to name a handful. We can see Rogen doing the iconic video game gorilla justice, but we’ll have to wait a little longer for any sort of confirmation on that take.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cranky-kong-fred-arimsen.png><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>Donkey Kong’s grandfather will be played by long-time SNL alum <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fred Armisen</a>, who is a comedic powerhouse, having created some of the most hilarious moments in a number of beloved sitcoms including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">30 Rock</a>, Parks and Recreation and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooklyn Nine Nine</a>. An impressive feat, considering in most of the above cases titles, Armisen only appears in singular episodes or scenes. We can’t wait to hear the undoubtedly quotable one-liners Armisen will bring to Cranky Kong.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Kamek (Kevin Michael Richardson)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kamek-kevin-michael-richardson.png><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>Bowser’s advisor and high-ranking Magikoopa Kamek was the first character we had the pleasure of hearing in the first Super Mario Bros. Movie trailer, and is being played by Kevin Michael Richardson. While we only got one line, Richardson sounds appropriately mystical and reverent of his big boss. Generally known for playing deep-voiced villains in various animated movies and TV shows, Richardson is flexing his voiceover chops in this film by giving an airier, more nasally performance to Kamek.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/spike-sebastian-maniscalco.png><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>The aptly named spike-spewing Koopa was not seen in the initial trailer, but we do know Bowser’s goon will be played by stand-up comic Sebastian Maniscalco, who has played supporting roles in Green Book and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Irishman</a>. Not a whole lot is known about Spike or Maniscalco’s involvement at the time of writing, but if he can bring the same comedic timing to Spike as he does to his standup, we’re sure to be in for a treat.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Penguin King (Khary Payton)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/penguin-king-khary-payton.png><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>It seems that despite his tenure as a king on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Walking Dead</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Khary Payton</a> isn’t quite done playing royalty just yet, having lent his talents to voicing the Penguin King as seen in the trailer. Besides the fact that Payton and his penguin pals appear to be out of their depth while defending against Bowser and his army of Koopas, we don’t know much else about the character, however fans are absolutely loving him and his penguin pals.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Koopas</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/koopas-mario-movie.png><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>While we didn’t spot any Goombas in the trailer, we can say with absolute certainty that there’ll be hordes upon hordes of Koopas for Mario and friends to face off against, with Bowser arriving at the Penguin King’s city with a literal army of them. Not that he needed his cannon fodder to begin with, with Kamek immobilizing the penguins singlehandedly, then blasting down the gates to the city with a roar of flames.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Dry Bones</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dry-bones-mario-movie.png><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>The ‘one last thing’ of the trailer saw Luigi in a bit of a predicament fleeing from a horde of Dry Bones, a skeletal and perhaps zombified variation of Koopas. These guys tend to appear in the spookier settings in Mario games, such as towers and castles – but we read that last little morsel involving Luigi and Dry Bones as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a bit of a nod to Luigi’s Mansion</a>. No doubt Luigi will encounter a Boo or two behind whatever door he slams shut behind him at the end of that trailer.</p><p data-characters=55 data-current-count=55 data-injectable=false>The Super Mario Bros.
