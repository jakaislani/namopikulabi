<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Stassi Schroeder | Plastic Surgery And Breast Reduction Surgery</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Not many well-known figures in the entertainment business would readily admit to having surgery. Here, Stassi Schroeder is an anomaly.</strong></p><p>The TV actress not only discusses her plastic surgery procedures candidly, but she also acknowledges that she is happy with them. In her book Next Level Basic: The Definitive Basic Bitch Handbook, she described all of the surgeries she has undergone up to this point in detail.</p><h2><span id=Stassi_Schroeder_Had_Breast_Reduction_Surgery_She_Might_Have_It_Done_Again>Stassi Schroeder Had Breast Reduction Surgery; She Might Have It Done Again</span></h2><p>Without question, one of the most genuine celebs out there is Stassi. In November 2015, the Vanderpump Rules star had breast reduction surgery, as she disclosed in 2017.</p><p>Schroeder previously posted an image on her Instagram account in which she candidly displayed the scars from the surgery she had in 2015. Fans praised Stassi for being authentic as soon as her photo became viral on the internet.</p><p>When questioned in 2017 about why she chose to display her scars, she said to PEOPLE,</p><p>“I said, ‘Don’t take my scars off.'” They’re fantastic. I think everyone should accept who they are because I like who I am. It’s a wound! The scars look good! It’s not something to be ashamed of, almost like a birthmark or something similar.</p><p>The citizen of Los Angeles moved from having a DDD cup to a D. It was, she admits, one of her best life decisions.</p><p>Stassi decided to have surgery since her breasts had grown to be very bothersome. Her breasts used to feel like “a book hanging like a pancake on her stomach,” she once said. Ever since she was twelve years old, she had fantasies about the procedure.</p><p>Upon discovering a good location for the procedure, the thirty-one-year-old ordered the surgeon to disregard any potential scars and simply butcher her.</p><p>That right there is bold!</p><p>Furthermore, Stassi isn’t finished yet because she plans to have another breast reduction procedure. “I would get another breast reduction even, I’ve always fantasized about being someone with no boobs,” she told Page Six in her explanation. You are free to dress whichever you like.</p><h2><span id=When_Stassi_Schroeder_was_eighteen_her_parents_gave_her_a_chin_implant_as_a_gift>When Stassi Schroeder was eighteen, her parents gave her a chin implant as a gift.</span></h2><p>Few parents would gladly and voluntarily consent to their children having surgery, but Stassi’s parents are an exception, just like her.</p><p>Stassi’s parents gave her a chin implant as a graduation present when she reached eighteen and graduated from high school. She was allowed to look through it by them. Stassi stated in an interview that she hasn’t looked back since her parents accepted her decision. She was therefore quite infatuated with having a prominent jawline and chin.</p><p>Stassi had to drink a lot of milkshakes and put up with excruciating discomfort for four days after the surgery until it subsided. It gave her a much-needed boost in confidence and helped her feel better about herself. It’s one of the best things I’ve ever done, and it still improves my self-esteem, the woman claims.</p><h2><span id=Stassi_Schroeder_Gets_Botox_and_Lip_Fillers_Her_Husband_Is_Against_Them>Stassi Schroeder Gets Botox and Lip Fillers; Her Husband Is Against Them</span></h2><p>Apart from the above-stated procedures, Stassi frequently uses Botox and Lip Fillers. At the age of 23, she began utilizing them and has continued to do so ever since. Stassi says she uses them in a “conservative” manner.</p><p>She gets rid of wrinkles on her face with Botox fillers, although she doesn’t use them when filming Vanderpump Rules or any other movie. Because Botox masks the true emotions on our faces, Stassi never uses it while she’s on set.</p><p>Stassi says Beau Clark has forbidden her from getting lip fillers ever since they started dating, primarily because it makes her seem like “a baboon.”</p><p>In the meanwhile, the couple had planned a destination wedding in Italy for October 2020; however, those preparations were derailed by COVID-19. However, the couple decided to get married despite the Covid epidemic.</p><p>The only thing that changed when the couple was married in September 2020 was that they didn’t travel to Italy. Speaking on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, the couple stated that they remain optimistic about their marriage.</p><p>In 2021, the couple welcomed a daughter into their family. They gave Hartford Charlie Rose Clark as the name of their first child.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Kaylin Wiley, Averie Gilley, and Sophierosejm."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":56}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/kaylin-wiley/"}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":"https://popularbio.com/averie-gilley/"}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":"https://popularbio.com/sophierosejm/"}{"1":56}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaylin Wiley</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Averie Gilley</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophierosejm</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>TV Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Maura Gillespie Wikipedia | Age And Husband</a></h3>A compelling storyteller and consultant in strategic communications, Maura Gillespie has been generating considerable buzz in the communications industry.
