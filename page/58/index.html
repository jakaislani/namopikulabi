After over a year of anticipation, slasher spectacle Scream VI is set to premiere in theaters this week. And while hype around the movie has been unsurprisingly sky-high, one specific controversy has plagued the project ever since it was initially announced back in June 2022. Of course, the controversy at hand relates to the notable and unexpected absence of OG franchise character Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) in the sixth installment of the film series.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>We Ordered Custom Oreos with OreoiD</h2><time>May 25, 2024</time>

I have finally found a way to merge my two favorite things: cats and sweets. I accomplished this by using the OreoiD website to create and order custom Oreos with a picture of my cat’s adorable, screaming face on them. We suspect this service largely exists to make gifts for others, but sometimes you just have to treat yourself, you know? Here’s how the process works, in case you want to surprise someone (or yourself).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Which CB antenna has longest range?</h2><time>May 25, 2024</time>
<a href=../../which-cb-antenna-has-longest-range.html></a>
The type of antennas with the greatest range are the stainless steel 102" whip antennas, which may not be practical for parking in garages, under trees, and so forth. The single center load antenna also has about the same transmit and receive range as the whip. How do I get the most range out of my CB radio? There are several procedures for ensuring maximum output.
TUNE THE RADIO. A CB radio is only as good as the coax and antenna connected to it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Karen Grassle: Biography, Actor</h2><time>May 24, 2024</time>

There's a budding love story between Marla and Frank that's complicated by their upbringing: Marla was raised Baptist and lives with her mom, who's peppy and friendly but extremely judgmental, while Frank is nearly as strict a Methodist. It's also complicated by the looming attentions of Hughes, who treats all his young starlets like members of a sheik's harem but doesn't have sex with any of them. In fact the one thing the actresses have in common with Hughes employees is that they've never met Hughes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Amber Arnett Missing, Lansing MI, Not yet Found</h2><time>May 23, 2024</time>

Recommended Videos Following his incredible run in Breaking Bad as Walter White, comic book fans inevitably started fantasy casting Bryan Cranston as pretty much any and every villain yet to find an actor to fill the role. The most popular suggestion, however, was Lex Luthor.
While he’s jokingly dismissed that in the past (mostly because he’s pretty sure people only named him as a favourite due to him&nbsp;already having done such a great job as one bald villain), there’s no denying that Cranston would be perfect for that role or any other he takes a fancy to in the superhero genre.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ryon Bingham</h2><time>May 23, 2024</time>

Roger Ebert I feel good! I knew that I would! Roger Ebert &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2009-01-14 I've been saying for years that I never cry during sad moments in the movies, only during moments about goodness. At the end of "Terms of Endearment," I didn't cry because of Debra Winger's death, but because of how she said goodbye to her sons. Now I've have discovered a scientific explanation for why I feel the way that I do, and there is even a name for my specific emotion.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/57/>← Prev Page</a>
