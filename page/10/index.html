I went to college at a small school in the middle of Ohio where there weren’t a ton of amazing dining options. There was a really solid Mexican restaurant, a Ruby Tuesday’s, and a couple fast food options, but my favorite by far was a bit of an oddity. It was a Greek restaurant, by all accounts. One side of the menu offered typical Greek dishes such as moussaka and tzatziki, but the other side of the menu seemed to be for a completely different restaurant serving Indian food—it even had a different name.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Daniel Nguyen</h2><time>Aug 28, 2024</time>

Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry star as Hank and Leticia, in two performances that are so powerful because they observe the specific natures of these two characters, and avoid the pitfalls of racial cliches. What a shock to find these two characters freed from the conventions of political correctness, and allowed to be who they are: weak, flawed, needful, with good hearts tested by lifetimes of compromise. They live in a Georgia town, circa 1990; Leticia works the night shift in a diner, has a fat little son and an ex-husband on Death Row; Hank works as a guard on Death Row, has a mean, racist father and a browbeaten son, and will be involved in Leticia's ex-husband's execution.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>tiktok star Archives - Page 9 of 85</h2><time>Aug 28, 2024</time>

That would not be a problem if his material made the sets irrelevant. It does not, especially toward the end of the film. You can only watch so much footage of a man crouched behind a barrier, pinned down by sniper fire, before the situation turns into a cinematic cliche. We've been here before, in other war movies, and we keep waiting for Kubrick to spring a surprise, but he never does.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/9/>← Prev Page</a>
