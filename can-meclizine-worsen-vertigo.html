Meclizine may be used to treat vertigo or nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness; however, it takes approximately an hour to start working and may cause drowsiness, although it is less likely than some other antihistamines to cause drowsiness.<h2>How does meclizine affect vertigo?</h2>Meclizine is used to prevent and control nausea, vomiting, and dizziness caused by motion sickness.

The sensory hair cells can then no longer pass information on to the brain.<h2>Why is meclizine a high risk medication?</h2>Meclizine Is Dangerous Because It Masks the Problem<p>The lack of root cause leaves the person with a balance impairment that has not been addressed, even if they no longer feel dizzy or spinny on the medication.

A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away.<h2>Why do I keep getting vertigo?</h2>Vertigo is commonly caused by a problem with the way balance works in the inner ear, although it can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain. Causes of vertigo may include: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) – where certain head movements trigger vertigo. migraines – severe headaches.<h2>What causes ear crystals to dislodge?</h2>The cause of BPPV is the displacement of small crystals of calcium carbonate (also known as canaliths) in the inner ear. Detachment of these crystals can be a result of injury, infection, diabetes, migraine, osteoporosis, lying in bed for long periods of time or simply aging.<h2>What happens if you take meclizine everyday?</h2>Side effects of long term use of medication for vertigo<p>Meclizine has side effects of dizziness, drowsiness and blurry vision which often result in higher risk of falling for older adults.
