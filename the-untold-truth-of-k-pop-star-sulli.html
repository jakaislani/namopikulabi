She opened up about that experience when she began co-hosting&nbsp;The Night of Hate Comments&nbsp;in 2019, just months before her untimely death. The troubled idol revealed that she actually managed to track down one of her haters, but chose not to prosecute them when she discovered they were a student at a prestigious university.</p><p>"If I wasn't lenient with a student who goes to such a good university, they'd become an ex-convict," Sulli said (via <a href=#>Soompi</a>).

"They said they were sorry and they hadn't known it would become such a large issue. They said they'd taken their stress out on me."</p><p>Since Sulli's passing, idols and academics alike have been urging the Korean government to implement changes and put an end to the endemic of cyberbullying. "Freedom of expression is a vital value in democratic society, but insulting and hurting someone else's dignity is beyond that limit," Lee Dong-gwi, who is a a psychology professor at Seoul's Yonsei University, said (via&nbsp;Channel News Asia).&nbsp;"There need to be far harsher penalties for those who violate that law."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9haX15e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5ymanqKhdqMGivoysrKWkmWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./la-times-tip-from-a-history-teacher-about-how-to-study-wwii-crossword-clue-answers-with-16-letters-1245519.html><span>←</span><span>LA Times Tip from a history teacher about how to study WWII?
