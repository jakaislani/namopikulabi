The British actress is an English actress, screenwriter, and activist who promotes sign language for the deaf through campaigns and promoting awareness of the issue.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, UK, is where the actress was born. She lived her entire childhood there, where she was born. The actress later attended two high schools, one of which was located in Cheadle. She enrolled in Stoke-on-Trent College to pursue performing arts after graduating from high school.</p><p style=text-align:justify>At the Edinburgh fringe festival in the beginning of her career, Rachel won her first critical praise. After that, she took on the part of Mitzeee Minniver and gained fame in the film industry.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The actress received the Academy Award in 2018 for the short film The Silent kid, in which she also created the script and starred.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.medadmbjmc.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rachel-Shenton-with-her-Husband-min-300x286.png><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kacy Byxbee (Scott Caan Wife): Bio, Wiki, Age, Career, Children, Family, Parents, Siblings</a></strong></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Rachel Shenton: Parents</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Even though she owns a property in Los Angeles, Rachel Shenton resides in London with her family. In Britain, she feels the most like herself.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Geoff Shenton, Rachel’s father, passed away when she was just 14 years old. The actress claims that she was 12 years old when she learned that her father had throat cancer.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Her father was successfully treated for cancer with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but the procedure left him permanently deaf. Even though the owner of a road haulage company heroically battled cancer, his hearing loss made him feel exposed.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Fortunately, her father was still able to speak his feelings. Later, Geoff picked up the skill of reading lips when conversing with people. Despite that, he would still feel excluded from the discourse when other people would suddenly speak.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The actress’s father passed away from the Earth in 2002 at the age of 69. At the time, Rachel was only 14 years old. She had been studying British Sign Language at the time.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She continued her sign language studies after her father’s departure and started doing volunteer work for deaf organizations in her leisure time.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The actress still has her mother Joy Shenton, despite the fact that she lost her father due to his weakness. She occasionally shares images of her mum for various events.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She occasionally publishes a picture on Instagram wishing someone a happy birthday, and other times she just shares love-themed photos.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The Academy Award-winning actress said that her part as Helen’s bond to Jenny’s younger sister is that of a mother figure. The actress talked candidly about her character, saying that she related to Helen and Jenny better than she did with Imogen in real life.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She said that after Jenny’s mother died, Helen filled the position of the mother figure. The sisters’ relationship has shifted from being siblings to friends at the end of the second season of the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.medadmbjmc.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rachel-Shenton-2-min-300x283.png><h2 style=text-align:justify>Rachel Shenton: Husband Chris Overton</h2><p style=text-align:justify>On the set of Hollyoaks, Rachel Shenton’s husband Chris Overton fell in love with her. In October 2018, Chris and Rachel exchanged vows.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She first met Chris when she was portraying Mitzeee Minniver in the British television series Hollyoaks. Chris is a multifaceted individual who has dabbled in acting, directing, and producing in the film industry.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Andy Overton and Lynne Overton, Chris’ parents, welcomed him into the world. In Cannock, Staffordshire, he was born, raised, and spent his whole youth. Ste Overton and Neil Overton are his other two siblings. The director has more than 20 years of experience in the motion picture business.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Currently, the director serves as the CEO of his own business, Slick Films.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Along with Rachel, the actor took home the Oscar for Best Live-Action Short Film for The Silent Child.</p><p style=text-align:justify>During the award ceremony, neither of the actors were wed. However, the couple did exchange vows that year, promising to remain a lifelong couple.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Since her time on Hollyoaks, Rachel Shenton has advanced significantly. Many people still associate her with her part as Anne “Mitzeee” Minniver from the Channel 4 serial opera, but since then, she has been in shows like White Gold and even appeared on American television in the ABC drama Switched at Birth.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She has also appeared on the red carpet since The Silent Child, a short film that advocates for the rights of the deaf and hard of hearing, earned her an Oscar in 2018.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Who knows where Rachel will go next given the impressive number of amazing projects she has previously completed.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The reason Rachel was motivated to study British Sign Language was deeply personal. In order to communicate with her father Geoff, who lost his hearing due to chemotherapy and was deaf as a result, Rachel, then 12 years old, studied sign language.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Her most recent appearance on CBBC’s Celebrity Supply Teacher had her responding to questions from kids about learning the language.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Rachel Shenton: Oscar</h2><ul><li style=text-align:justify>The Silent Child, a short film directed by Rachel, received an Oscar at the 90th Academy Awards.</li><li style=text-align:justify>The movie centers on Libby, a four-year-old deaf girl who has trouble speaking (Maisie Sly plays her).</li><li style=text-align:justify>Chris Overton, Rachel’s husband, directed the movie, and Rachel wrote the script.</li><li style=text-align:justify>Throughout her award speech, Rachel used signing to convey her words. I promised to sign this speech to our lead actress, who is six years old, she remarked. I’m sorry; my hands are a little trembling.</li><li style=text-align:justify>She continued, “The movie is about a deaf child who is born into a world of quiet. “This is actually happening; it’s not overblown or sensationalized for the film. Many children around the world struggle to communicate, live in silence, and have limited access to education.</li><li style=text-align:justify>The “exact opposite” of Rachel Shenton’s Mitzeee Minniver in Hollyoaks is Mitzeee Minniver.</li><li style=text-align:justify>The Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, where she played Mitzeee Minniver, is where Rachel is best known. She appeared in 235 episodes between 2010 and 2013 playing the ambitious beauty model.</li><li style=text-align:justify>The actress once said of her character: “Mitzeee’s the reverse of me – she’s a bit of a want tobe WAG and she’s extremely manipulative. She will undoubtedly cause some commotion and agitation.</li><li style=text-align:justify>Rachel has been actively involved in numerous causes even while she was a student. When she was younger, she volunteered at the Deaflinks organization in her community. She then became an advocate for the National Deaf Children’s Society and even performed a jump for their benefit.</li><li style=text-align:justify>Her additional charitable activity includes raising money and awareness for Action for Hearing Loss by scaling the BT Tower in London.

Shenton stated that her character was the exact opposite of her.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Her appointment was made as a part of the serial’s significant makeover under new producer Paul Marquess.
