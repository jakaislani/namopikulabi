Unfortunately, despite how much hype there was for his Universal Championship reign when he first won it, nobody seems to be interested in the idea of his time as champion continuing.</p><p>That’s probably because The Fiend has taken off in a way that few could’ve imagined. He could quite easily hold the belt all the way through until WrestleMania if he does wind up winning it, and that’s what we’d put our money on.</p><p>There are so many great challengers for Bray if he does become champion but before all of that, we need to remember some of the best moments from Rollins’ reign – because it may be a while before he gets it back.</p><p>Either way, there is a great deal of potential in the actual match itself on Sunday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e5BpZmlqX6iytbSMq6alpJmjwG610mapnpmUrnqnu9Fmq6GdXZu2prrDZpmrmalixLqt061kmqCVlrFuu8VmrrCdXZ2yrbiMoqVmmV2Ysq24jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./henry-cavill-shares-the-witcher-selfie-as-geralt-from-private-collection.html><span>←</span><span>Henry Cavill shares The Witcher selfie as Geralt from private collection</span></a>
