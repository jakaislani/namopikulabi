<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Who Is Zade Batal | Meet Em Beihold Boyfriend | Wiki And Relationship Explore</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Is Em Beihold’s boyfriend, Zade Batal, concerned about her mental health? How did the filmmaker-musician collaboration come about? More information can be found in the article.</strong></p><p>Em Beihold, born January 21, 1999, is an American singer-songwriter best known for her famous song “Until I Found You,” on which she collaborated as a featured artist with Stephen Sanchez. Beihold’s singing career began when filmmaker Michelle Schumacher approached her and requested her to write a song called “Not Who We Were” for the film “I’m Not Here.”</p><p>Michelle clearly has a keen eye for talent, as Em Beihold has continued to gain attention for her musical ability on social media, particularly TikTok. Her singing videos not only caught the attention of her new fans, but they also led to her signing with ‘Republic Records,’ where she released her first hit single, ‘Numb Little Bug.’</p><h2>Who is Em Beihold’s boyfriend, Zade Batal?</h2><p>Em Beihold, a young and talented model, may have many male admirers, but the 24-year-old beauty has a partner who is equally outstanding. Many Em fans may not recognize the name ‘Zade Batal.’ He is an accomplished photographer and filmmaker. Em Beihold’s partner, Zade Batal, is a Los Angeles-based filmmaker, photographer, and creative director.</p><p>Throughout his career, he has worked with a diverse spectrum of corporations, performers, and social media superstars. Zade’s decision to change his professional path and become a creative director for bands was one of the main reasons he became Em Beihold’s boyfriend.</p><p>The young and beautiful couple seemed to be madly in love. Em can’t stop posting photos of herself that her partner, Zade, has taken. Em and Zade started dating shortly after the outbreak began. They met on the set of one of Em’s music videos. Zade was the video’s creative director. In an interview, Em says that she and Zade didn’t think they’d ever date. Em also stated that Zade was too introverted for her. Their paths were meant to cross in some way. Surprisingly, they started off as friends before dating.</p><h2>How Did Em Beihold’s Boyfriend Zade Batal Assist Her During Her Darkest Hours?</h2><p>Em Beihold’s presence was critical in her life, as she stated in a TikTok video that she couldn’t have survived the lockdown without Zade’s help. Em has been honest about her depressive struggles since the beginning of her popularity. She wants others to realize that having mental health problems is normal.</p><p>They should be treated in the same way that other illnesses are. The singer also wrote the song ‘Numb Little Bug,’ which highlights her fight with depression and how you can suffer even when things appear to be going well. In her TikTok video, she also admits that her mental health has left her lover Zade feeling a little overwhelmed at times.</p><p>Em Beihold’s boyfriend Zade Batal was constantly by her side, even when things were terrible. Em Beihold admitted to having panic attacks when suffering from anxiety in public. She tells in a TikTok video how her partner Zade could tell when she was uncomfortable and would do things to distract her.</p><p>Em had to do a lot of touring when his smash song ‘Until I Found You’ got successful. People just saw her glitz and shine, but only Zade was aware of her anxiety issues. He would go out of his way to be with his beloved, even rearranging meetings to be near her. He assisted her in overcoming her nerves prior to the show and later in promoting her songs. We’re not sure about modern fairytales, but Em Beihold’s lover is certainly a prince to his singing princess, or perhaps a ‘Romeo to Juliet.’</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Filmmaker</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Musician</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Amy Fickell’s Husband Luke Fickell?
