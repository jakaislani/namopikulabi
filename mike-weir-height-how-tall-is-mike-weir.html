He was a natural left-handed shooter and started playing golf left-handed as a natural progression from hockey.</p><p>Early in his adolescence, Weir quit up hockey after realizing that golf was his finest sport and that he would never grow larger than average. Yet, he had heard that if he switched to playing right-handed, he might become an even better golfer.</p><p>He graduated from St. Clair Secondary School in Sarnia and St. Michael Elementary School in Brights Grove. In 1988, he won the Ontario Junior Championship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He earned a degree in recreation management from Brigham Young University and won the Ontario Amateur Championship in 1990 and 1992.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He placed second in a tie at the 1991 and 1992 Canadian Amateur Championships, respectively. He was chosen for the Second Team of the 1992 All-Americans at BYU.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mike Weir career</h2><p>Weir began his career as a pro in 1992 on the Canadian Professional Golf Tour, where he won three tournaments.</p><p>Early in his career, he also participated in a few tournaments on the Asian PGA Tour. He first became a member of the PGA Tour in 1998, but owing to poor play, he was expelled.</p><p>At the 1999 Air Canada Championship in Surrey, British Columbia, Weir earned his first PGA Tour victory. He became the first Canadian to win a PGA Tour competition in Canada in 45 years with the triumph.</p><p>Weir won the 2003 Masters Tournament, one of the four major tournaments, in April in Augusta, Georgia. He is the only man from Canada to have ever won a major professional title.</p><p>Weir reached his greatest position in the Official World Golf Ranking, third, in June after tying for third at the U.S. Open, the second major.</p><p>In February 2004, Weir became the sixth player in Nissan Open history to record back-to-back victories and the first since Corey Pavin. He joined a rare group of players, including Ben Hogan, who had won consecutive titles at the tournament (1994, 1995).</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>After his second victory at the Nissan Open, Weir had to wait more than three and a half years until his next professional victory. Several fruitful outcomes came from collaborating with Mike Bennett and Andy Plummer on a new swing (two top tens, including a tie for eighth at the Open Championship).</p><p>Due to a damaged elbow ligament, Weir’s 2010 campaign was cut short. He had a major medical exemption going into 2011, therefore in order to keep his full Tour status, he would need to make up the difference between his 2010 earnings and $786,977 (equal to Troy Merritt, who ended with the 125th and final exempt slot on the Tour), in five starts.</p><p>Weir’s 2010 and 2011 seasons were marred by injuries, and he started his 2012 campaign at the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am after spending six months rehabilitating from elbow surgery.</p><p>Weir, who was playing on a top 50 lifetime money list exemption for 2014, came within two strokes of winning his first tournament in seven years at the Byron Nelson Tournament, but instead finished in a tie for tenth place with Brendon Todd.</p><p>Weir declared in 2019 that he would play the entire PGA Tour season on the Web.com Tour, taking use of an exemption for former players 48 and older to try and get back on the PGA Tour or to get ready for the PGA Tour Champions.</p><p>Weir won his first Golf Tour Champions contest in May 2021. The Woodlands, Texas, Insperity Invitational was won by Weir. This was his first triumph on a global scale since 2007, other than the five-man 2010 Telus Skins Game.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How tall is Mike Weir?</h2><p>Weir stands at a height of 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 70kg.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqagpJ1drLKqvoyhnKKfmKl6qbvWZquapJxitrR5zKKinmWnmrazew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./franklin-teacher-arrested-for-alleged-sxual-misconduct.html><span>←</span><span>Franklin Teacher Arrested For Alleged S*xual Misconduct With A Student</span></a>
