Earlier this month when NVIDIA announced the 2017 version of the SHIELD TV, the company also announced that the updated, Android 7.0-based OS that was at the heart of the miniaturized STB would also be coming to the existing 2015 models. Now, just a bit under 2 weeks after the retail launch of the new model, NVIDIA has released their promised update as Software Upgrade 5.0.2.
Under the hood, the big change here of course is the upgrade to Android 7.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Patang movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2012)</h2><time>Jul 6, 2024</time>

The story is told in a straightforward way, as the relationship between a nearly hopeless man on the ground and the pilot of a Cessna Skymaster who returns day and night to maintain radio contact until a helicopter rescue mission can be mounted.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>CPU Performance - Five Generations of Mac Pros Compared</h2><time>Jul 5, 2024</time>

CPU Performance I like to have large historical databases of performance so I can put new products in perspective. The Mac Pro and its funny lineage make this a little difficult. For starters, I simply haven't reviewed all of the Mac Pro CPU combinations that have existed over the years. Then there's also the fact that not all of my Mac suite applies well to a 12-core/24-thread Mac Pro. I'm going to try my best to put the new Mac Pro's performance in perspective, but it's going to require a couple of subsections.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sandra Ifudu Biography: Wikipedia, Age, Husband, Movies, Songs, Net Worth</h2><time>Jul 5, 2024</time>

If the music is crucial to ‚ÄúAguirre, the Wrath of God,‚Äù so is the face of Klaus Kinski. He has haunted blue eyes and wide, thick lips that would look sensual if they were not pulled back in the rictus of madness. Here he plays the strongest-willed of the conquistadors. Herzog told me that he was a youth in Germany when he saw Kinski for the first time: ‚ÄúAt that moment I knew it was my destiny to make films, and his to act in them.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>AVADirect Silent Gaming PC: An Exercise in Balance</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>

One of the benefits of going with a boutique builder is being able to get custom machines that are a little more specialized than what you might get from HP or even Alienware.

Boutiques can cherry pick existing hardware and modify it for specific purposes, gearing each build to suit the end user's exact needs.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/36/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
