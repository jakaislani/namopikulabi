The range of images seen below show Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) and Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) in their classic comic book outfits, and they both look great.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>As you can see, by the finale, Nygma will have upgraded from his green suits and bowler hat and will have properly become the Riddler, with question marks covering his clothes and a spiffy pair of sunglasses to boot. Meanwhile, Cobblepot is definitely the Penguin now, as he’s wearing a theatrical purple suit, top hat and monocle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DsYVhbNU8AEhbLp.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DsYVjiEU8AAw253.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DsYVkM9UwAEjNYo.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DsYVipmU8AAcCd8.jpg><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>We can even work out what’s going on in this scene from the set pics. By the looks of things, Riddler and Penguin are involved in some criminal activity out on Gotham’s streets and they end up getting strewn up to a lamppost. What’s the betting that the Dark Knight himself was responsible for that, no doubt leaving them at Commissioner Gordon’s mercy?</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>Yes, we’re definitely getting Batman as well in the finale. Showrunner John Stephens has been very open about promising this to fans and has even given us <a href=# rel=noopener>a hint at what sort of suit the vigilante will wear</a> in the episode. Apparently, we can expect a&nbsp;Dark Knight Rises-style number.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false><strong>Gotham</strong> season 5 – subtitled “Legend of the Dark Knight” – runs for 12 installments and kicks off on FOX from January 3rd.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yxsc2grKKmXae2pbDLnqlmnJ%2BjeqS4wKyqoptdmLy0wNSmnKxll6TBqa3MZp2ippGhsm61zJqenmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dominic-sena.html><span>←</span><span>Movies directed by Dominic Sena</span></a>
