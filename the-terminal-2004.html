<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>The Terminal movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2004)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Dixon wants Navorski out of the terminal because, well, he can't live there forever, but he shows every indication of being prepared to. "Why doesn't he escape?" Dixon asks his underlings, as Navorski stands next to an open door that Dixon has deliberately left unguarded. Dixon's plan is to pass Navorski on to another jurisdiction: "You catch a small fish and unhook him very carefully. You place him back in the water, so that someone else can have the pleasure of catching him."</p><p>Dixon could arrest Navorski unfairly, but refuses to: "He has to break the law." Navorski, who speaks little English but is learning every day, refuses to break the law. He won't even lie when Dixon offers him political asylum. "Are you afraid of returning to your country?" "Not afraid," he says simply. "But aren't you afraid of <i><i>something</i></i>?" "I am afraid for ... ghosts," says Navorski.</p><p>The terminal is filled with other characters Navorski gets to know, such as Amelia the flight attendant (<a href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>), who is having an affair with a married man and finds she can open her heart to this strange, simple man. And Gupta the janitor (<a href=#>Kumar Pallanatucci</a>), who leaves the floor wet and watches as passengers ignore the little yellow warning pyramids and slip and fall. "This is the only fun I have," he says. And a food services employ (<a href=#>Diego Luna</a>), who is in love with an INS official (<a href=#>Zoe Saldana</a>) and uses Navorski as his go-between.</p><p>These friends and others have secret social lives in the terminal, feasting on airline food, playing poker. Navorski becomes their hero when he intervenes in a heart-rending case. A Russian man has medicine he needs to take to his dying father, but Dixon says it must stay in the United States. The man goes berserk, a hostage situation threatens, but Navorski defuses the situation and finds a solution that would have pleased Solomon.</p><p>Tom Hanks does something here that many actors have tried to do, and failed. He plays his entire role with an accent of varying degrees of impenetrability, and it never seems like a comic turn or a gimmick, and he never seems to be doing it to get a laugh. He gets laughs, but his acting and the writing are so good, they seem to evolve naturally. That is very hard to do. He did the same thing in "<a href=#>Forrest Gump</a>," and Navorski is another character that audiences will, yes, actually love. The screenplay also sidesteps various hazards that a lesser effort would have fallen to, such as a phony crisis or some kind of big action climax. "The Terminal" doesn't have a plot; it <i><i>tells a story</i></i>. We want to know what will happen next, and we care.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lpJq%2FrrXNmqNmamBlgQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miss-blythe-scandal-everything-to-know-about-the-viral-twitter-video.html><span>←</span><span>Miss Blythe Scandal: Everything To Know About The Viral Twitter Video</span></a>
