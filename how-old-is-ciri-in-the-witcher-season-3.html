After she manages to escape, Ciri meets Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf, the Butcher of Blaviken, her destined father via the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Law of Surprise</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>Bound by destiny to protect Ciri from those who wish her harm, Geralt employs the assistance of Yennefer of Vengerberg. As one of the most powerful mages on the Continent, Geralt has faith that Yennefer can train Ciri in the ways of magical arts (after she almost sacrifices Ciri to get her powers back, of course; a misunderstanding that lands her out of favor with Geralt, but eventually rights itself).</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>If Yennefer can help Ciri control her magic, maybe then Ciri can protect herself from harm and harness her chaos for good.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>And to think, all this trouble from a girl so young. From a tiny little pent-up powder keg in season one to a skilled Witcher and Mage-in-training in seasons two and three, Ciri’s evolution happens right before our very eyes. Nevertheless, it can be a bit tricky to discern just how old she really is, especially since the first season’s timeline hops all over the place.</p><h2 id=h-exactly-how-old-is-ciri-in-season-three-anyway data-injectable=false>Exactly how old is Ciri in season three, anyway?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Freya-Allan-as-Ciri-in-The-Witcher.jpg><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Good question. If we’re going strictly off the Netflix series, then Ciri was barely a teenager during the events of season one. The slaughter of Cintra occurred in 1263, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">show’s main site</a>. Since Ciri was born in 1250, that made her 13 years old.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>Season two concludes in 1964 when the White Flame (ahem, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you-know-who</a>) reaches Cintra. That would make Ciri 14 years old during this time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As for season three</a> — the show picks up soon after the events of season two with Ciri, Yennefer, and Gerlt on the run. How much time passes in the season is vague, but the first episode shows the trio jumping from one safe house to the next, sometimes spending as much as a month in one location.</p><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=105 data-injectable=false>Ciri is likely still 14 years old, but by the time the season ends, she will probably push 15 years old.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>What we do know, based on what she told Yennefer and Geralt, is that she was born on Belleteyn, the fertility festival that attracts townsfolk far and wide.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=false>If anything, Ciri will certainly be 15 years old during season four. That is, if we don’t get a major time jump (you know, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Henry Cavill leaving the show and all</a>). For now, because we don’t have an exact date, it’s safe to say she is somewhere on the cusp of 14 and 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpqWcXZ7Abq%2FIq6BmoZ5iwamxjLCgrZuYmr9uv8SaqqimXWh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flavia-pavanelli.html><span>←</span><span>Flavia Pavanelli movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
