If you said yes to any of those questions then you are in luck, because this is a list of the best non-dairy dips for your chip dippin’ pleasure.</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Whole Foods 365 Roasted Garlic Hummus</strong></a><p>Ah yes, the flagship non-dairy dip. The garlicky, tahini-y, “it” girl of the vegan world. It’s hummus, baybee, and she’s here to rock your non-dairy world. This hummus from Whole Foods specifically is one of the best dips if you don’t eat dairy due to its “deep garlicky flavor,” umami punch, and creamy texture. It’s like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French onion dip</a> but without the onions. Or the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sour cream</a>. Or the French. Plus, you can eat it with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pita chips</a> sure, but also Lay’s are great in it, as are veggies, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pretzels</a>, falafel—you name it, hummus will go great.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Hummus: Dip into the 7 Best Hummus Brands You Can Buy</a></strong></p><p>This is such a bomb salsa. It is just so dod derned fresh tasting and yes, as a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">salsa</a>, it obviously does not contain dairy, so it does indeed belong on this list of best non-dairy dips. Senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> noted that this was “easily the most flavorful salsa we tasted during our extensive research,” and that comes as no surprise to me—I buy this stuff on the reg, and let me tell you, it is a highlight of my day. Treat your non-dairy self to some of this salsa and a big ol’ bag of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tortilla chips</a> the next time you are at the store. You won’t regret it.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Store Bought Salsa: The 7 Best Salsa Brands to Spice Up Your Life</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Hope Foods Spicy Green Chile Guacamole</strong></a><p>Whaddaya know? It’s the millennial’s caviar: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">guacamole</a>. Now, I don’t know if anyone is actually calling it “millennial’s caviar”—millennials certainly aren’t—but who knows? Maybe it will catch on? Either way, guacamole is a classic creamy dip for chips that doesn’t require a single drop of moo moo juice. Lactose-intolerant people all know that guac is certainly one of the best dips if you don’t eat dairy. Plus, this guac is gorgeous. Contributor Danny Palumbo noted that the “heat and subtle garlic bite doesn’t overpower the avocado itself, which is nice and thick,” and he liked the fruity heat of the habanero that permeates this delicious dip, as well as the short, simple ingredient list. Check this one out if you haven’t yet.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Guacamole: Our Updated Ranking</a></strong></p><p>Looking to scratch that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">onion dip</a> itch but dairy unfortunately turns your intestines into a runaway train? Look no further than this vegan everything cream cheese from Kite Hill, which Jordan said “comes off as more than just a cream cheese.” How so? Well, they continued to point out that while you could put the stuff on a bagel, “it would also make an incredible dip for veggies or a luxurious sandwich spread.” Y’all need to try this one out. It is truly one of the best non-dairy dips and it’s not really even technically a dip.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Build Your Perfect Plant-Based Bagel with These Vegan Cream Cheeses</a></strong></p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trader Joe’s Vegan Nacho Dip</a></strong><p>This <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vegan queso</a> is so good it will have you saying, “Hey that’s nacho dip, it’s my dip!”&nbsp;It is oniony and garlicky which makes it taste cheesy, and it is creamy as all get out from the cashews, coconut oil, and tapioca starch. Sporked editor-in-chief <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Sterling</a> described it as “tangy—almost like cheddar—and very smooth,” and she also pointed out that, unlike the other vegan queso dips we tried, “you can eat it cold (though it is still better warm).” So go get some tortilla chips and other fixins, and then add this to your list of bests non-dairy dips for your next vegan party.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Vegan Queso Dip for Dairy-Free Partying</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Chipotle Bitchin’ Sauce</strong></a><p>Here at Sporked, we love a good <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitchin’ Sauce</a>, and we like this one the most. It is smoky, creamy, umami, almond-based, and most of all, it is actually spicy (which we love). Jordan said this dip would be perfect for a vegan form of “sandwich spread, vegetable dip, or even a pasta sauce (if you’re feeling freaky).” And, Jordan? We are feelin’ freaky. I also have to add that this stuff is great with pita chips, pretzels—really anything can be dipped in this, for lack of a better word, “bitchin’” sauce.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Spicy Dip for a Spicy Time!</a></strong></p><h2>Subscribe</h2><p>Get all the top food rankings, new product reviews, and other grocery content delivered to your inbox every other week.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>By clicking submit you agree to our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terms of Use</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFusMipqmaen6d6pLTIqapmoZZixrDBjJ2mp6xdmq61ecOaoKuxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./artist-won-photography-competition-ai-generated-image-sony-world-awards-2023-4.html><span>←</span><span>Artist Won Photography Competition With AI-Generated Image</span></a>
