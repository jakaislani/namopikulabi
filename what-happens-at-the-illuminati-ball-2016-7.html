We got a special invite from Von Buhler herself, and here's as much information as I can divulge&nbsp;of my experience.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Von Buhler's Illuminati Ball was greatly inspired by one of the strangest dinner parties ever hosted by Marie-Hélène de Rothschild, of the elite Rothschild family, in 1972. Leaked photos from the evening reveal guests such as Salvador Dali and Audrey Hepburn dressed in elaborate, surrealist garb. Mrs. Rothschild herself greeted guests in a white gown and stag's head with diamond tears.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Leaked image from Marie-Hélène de Rothschild's 1972 event. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Image courtesy of The Illuminati Ball</span></span></figure><h2 class=slide-title-text>Conspiracy theorists have written about the symbolism at the event, which connected the Rothschild family to the Illuminati. Dismembered baby dolls were placed on the dining tables, supposedly meaning to represent human sacrifice, and the outside of the chateau was lit in a blazing red, representing the satanic rituals that were to be done inside. All of these themes were touched on during the Illuminati Ball that I attended.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Leaked image from Marie-Hélène de Rothschild's 1972 event. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Image courtesy of The Illuminati Ball</span></span></figure><h2 class=slide-title-text>Von Buhler's rendition was clearly inspired by the Rothschilds' party. We were picked up by a limousine on the Upper East Side and taken on an hour-long ride to Connecticut. The blinds were drawn, and champagne was served. Near the end of our trip, all phones were collected, and there was no way to know where exactly we were. When we arrived, we were greeted by our hosts, the Pig King and his wife. The initiation tests began immediately.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The Pig King and his wife at "The Illuminati Ball." <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Mark Shelby Perry</span></span></figure><h2 class=slide-title-text>"I wanted to create tests for our guests," Von Buhler told Business Insider. "Who will they side with and why? Will guests go with the pack mentality or will they stand up for what they believe is right? I want to leave them thinking about the choices they make."</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Mark Shelby Perry</span></span></figure><h2 class=slide-title-text>Fire dancers greeted us when we first arrived.

Do you want to sit in the sauna? Dip into the milk bath? Skinny dip in the lake outside? Or create mischief? These are all personal choices that everyone must make.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Mark Shelby Perry</span></span></figure><h2 class=slide-title-text>When applying to purchase tickets, guests are asked to identify themselves as either a pig, monkey, mouse, cow or chicken. Each animal represents various personality traits. Choose wisely — your self-identifying animal kinship will shape your entire night.

A handful of guests came to the event alone, while others brought their significant other or best friend. Some were self-proclaimed immersive-theater addicts, and others simply wanted an escape from their everyday, controlled environment.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The mouse leader reads aloud guest's names, occupation, and desires. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Mark Shelby Perry</span></span></figure><h2 class=slide-title-text>The house, owned by Von Buhler herself, is an extravagant country home.

As a guest, the lines were already blurred between reality and fiction. Over the next few hours we were caught in the drama of our animal-kinship leaders — rumors flew across the party about various leaders, human sacrifices were spoken of, and choices had to be made about where your loyalty lay.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The Pig King, our host for the evening, explaining the Illuminati. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Mark Shelby Perry</span></span></figure><h2 class=slide-title-text>Dancers performed in private rooms ...</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 class=slide-title-text>... and red wine and various cocktails were served throughout the evening.

"It is extremely complicated to write an immersive play," she said. "You need to be open to spontaneity in order to create immersive theater.
